The upcoming Twenty20 World Cup has been moved out of India and the tournament will now be played in the United Arab Emirates, sources told NDTV. The tournament will begin on October 17 and the final will take place on November 14. Earlier this month, news agency PTI had reported that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has internally intimated the ICC that they wouldn't mind the T20 World Cup being held in the UAE. On June 1, the International Cricket Council in a statement had said that the BCCI will keep the hosting rights of the event regardless of where the event is played.

"A final decision on the host country will be taken later this month. The Board also confirmed that the BCCI will remain the hosts of the event regardless of where the event is played," ICC had mentioned in a statement.

Interestingly the BCCI had already announced that the remaining matches of the 14th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be played. However, the Indian board is yet to announce the official schedule for the resumption of the T20 league.

<h3>2. EURO 2021:</h3>
<p>Euro 2021: "Underdogs" Austria Hoping For Exploit Against Italy

Highlights
Austria hopeful of beating Italy in the Round of 16 in Euro 2020David Alaba said It's a special match for us, in a very special stadiumAlaba won the Champions League at Wembley stadium with Bayern Munich
Austria coach Franco Foda said Friday that despite being "underdogs" his side were hopeful of making history with a win against Italy in their Euro 2020 last 16 clash at Wembley. Austria advanced from the opening round at a major tournament for the first time since the 1982 World Cup, reaching the knockout phase of the European Championship for the first time. "We know we're the underdog and it's difficult to judge our realistic chances but even with 10 percent you can achieve a lot," Foda told a press conference in London. Austria advanced second in Group C after a 1-0 win over Ukraine, bouncing back from losing 2-0 to the Netherlands.

Italy led the way in Group A with three wins, seven goals scored and none conceded.

"This team has already achieved something spectacular but now we're focused on taking the next step to make it to Munich," continued Foda.

"We have a lot of confidence after the match against Ukraine."

For Foda "the Italian squad has convinced the most" in this tournament.

"Even in the third match they looked strong despite making a lot of changes. They are a dangerous squad," he said.

"Even after a good game, you always think about what you can improve in the team. 

"Italy is very different (from Ukraine), but you can assume that I will not change much. Technically maybe we'll tweak a little bit here and there on and off the ball."

Italy have won all four of their previous meetings against Austria at major tournaments.

"We've already wrote history to make it into the round of 16 and would be beyond happy if we could beat Italy."

Captain David Alaba said he felt "a very positive connection" to Wembley, where he won the 2013 Champions League with Bayern Munich.

"For me personally it's a special match, but not only for me, for the whole team and I think for the whole nation as well.

"I can remember back in 2013, there was a special evening and the day before was also very special. 

"It was the Champions League final so the atmosphere within the city you could feel that a great event was coming up, tomorrow is going to be similar for us. 

"It's a special match for us, in a very special stadium."</p>

<h3>3. Tennis update: Wimbledon: Defending Champion Simona Halep Withdraws Due To Injury</h3>
<p>
Simona Halep said she was "really down and upset" at not being able to defend her ladies singles title at Wimbledon due to a calf injury. The 29-year-old Romanian had been battling to be fit since withdrawing from her second round match at the Italian Open in mid-May. "It is with great sadness that I'm announcing my withdrawal from The Championships as my calf injury has not fully recovered," she said. Halep's withdrawal came minutes before the draw for the championships which get underway on Monday.

Halep secured her second Grand Slam singles crown beating Serena Williams in 2019 -- due to the coronavirus pandemic the Grand Slam event was cancelled last year.

She joins four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka in withdrawing.
